# Hodking and Huxley model for the membrane action potential

This is a study on the Hodking-Huxley model for the action potential. The code in this repository is based on differential equations derived from the cell membrane's equivalent circuits. The reader will find two main sets of equations: the ones describing the generation of the action potential (AP), and the ones describing the AP propagation throughout axons. 

For the first set of equations, we employ Euler's method for differential equations solving. For the latter, we aimed at developing the set of equations.
